## Methodology

Overall methodology to determine sector GHG emission is shown in Figure 2. First the values of fuel and energy usage contained in the energy balances are structured along relevant sectors that better match those in the CoM template. Then emission factors are applied accordingly covering fuel to energy or energy directly into CO2 and CH4 emissions. This procedure is common for the cases of emission in the transport, buildings, electricity and industry. For the case of CH4 emissions from waste disposal are determined following the approach [IPCC default method approach](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/bgp/5_1_CH4_Solid_Waste.pdf).

## Emission factors

To convert energy values into CO2 and CH4 gases released into the atmosphere a number of so-called emission factors are used. These are reported in Tables 1 and 2 and are broadly equal to those in Sarajevo's Sustainable Energy and Adaptation Plan (SEAP) submitted to the CoM in 2008.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fuel<-c("Heating","Electricity","Natural gas","Fuel oil","LPG","Mazut","Lignite","Gasoline","Diesel","Wood","Wood")
conversion<-c("MWh to ton CO2","MWh to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2",
              "TJ to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2","TJ to ton CO2","MWh to ton CO2")
factor<-c("0.282","0.72","56.99","71.83","63.89","78.23","101.2","70.08","73.91","0","0.43")
source<-c("Sarajevo 2008 SEAP","IEA (2011), published by ADEME","Sarajevo 2008 SEAP","Sarajevo 2008 SEAP",
          "Sarajevo 2008 SEAP","Sarajevo 2008 SEAP","Sarajevo 2008 SEAP","Sarajevo 2008 SEAP","Sarajevo 2008 SEAP",
          "Sarajevo 2008 SEAP (assumes that all wood is sustainably extracted)","IPCC (assumes that wood is not sustianbly extracted)")
tab1<-cbind.data.frame("Energy vector"=fuel,"conversion"=conversion,"factor"=factor,"source"=source)
knitr::kable(tab1, "simple", caption = "Table 1 - Emission factors used for energy-CO2 conversions")

```

Energy to CH4 (methane) conversion factors were also used in order to provide final GHG emissions in CO2eq. These factors are showin in Table 2 and are taken from the [IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol2.html).


```{r, echo=FALSE}
fuel2<-c("Natural gas","Fuel oil","LPG","Mazut","Lignite","Gasoline","Diesel","Wood")
conversion2<-c("TJ to ton CH4","TJ to ton CH4","TJ to ton CH4","TJ to ton CH4",
              "TJ to ton CH4","TJ to ton CH4","TJ to ton CH4","TJ to ton CH4")
factor2<-c("0.005","0.005","0.005","0.005","0.010","0.005","0.005","0.3")
source2<-c("IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006","IPCC 2006")
tab2<-cbind.data.frame("Energy vector"=fuel2,"conversion"=conversion2,"factor"=factor2,"source"=source2)
knitr::kable(tab2, "simple", caption = "Table 2 - Emission factors used for energy-CO2 conversions")

```

Since the elaboration of the GHG inventory information on emission factors started being [organized sistematicaly](https://www.climatiq.io/) along the lines of countries and activities and increasingly available. This allows to expand on the admittedly narrow range of emission factors available which narrows comparability. In Table 3 a comparison is provided for the case of emission associated with electricity supply.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
activity<-c("Electricity from grid","Electricity from grid","Electricity from grid")
region<-c("Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bosnia and Herzegovina")
factor3<-c("0.723","0.5585","1.046")
year<-c("2021","2020","2017")
conversion3<-c("kWh to CO2e","kWh to CO2e","kWh to CO2e")
source3<-c("ADEME","AIB","CHG protocol")
tab2<-cbind.data.frame("Activity"=activity,"Region"=region,"Conversion"=conversion3,"Factor"=factor3,"source"=source3)
knitr::kable(tab2, "simple", caption = "Table 3 - Comparisson of emission factors for electricty supply")
