## Sarajevo canton
### Summary
This website details the data and methodology for converting Sarajevo's energy balances into a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory. The inventory covers the energy intensive sectors of buildings, electricity, transport and industry. In addition, emissions associated with waste disposal are also evaluated (see Figure 1).

![Figure 1 - Economic sectors included in the emission inventory](https://ghg-sarajevo.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/scope.jpg){width=700px}

The bulk of the data used is taken from the energy balances published by the Ministry of Economy [(Ministarstvo privrede)](https://mp.ks.gov.ba/) and included the needs for electricity, natural gas, oil derivatives and solid fuels associated with annual consumption in the canton (see section References below). Balances were available on an yearly basis and for the purposes of this inventory data for the years 2016 to 2020 is used.

The main results of the inventory can be seen in the section [Monitoring](https://climetrics.github.io/sarajevo/Links.html). while details of the methods and data used can be consulted in section [Methodology](https://climetrics.github.io/sarajevo/Journal.html).

## Opportunities and challenges

### Always up-to-date GHG monitoring

GHG monitoring is unavoidable in order to evaluate progress towards decarbonisation. Fortunately, the energy balances as published by the Ministry of Economy [(Ministarstvo privrede)](https://mp.ks.gov.ba/) are regularly published and their information well suited to be the cornerstone of Sarajevo's GHG monitoring. Balances were extensively used in this reporting and would be relatively easy to interface the results into a regular GHG monitoring scheme. Basic steps and recommendations to achieve this are:

* Align with *Ministarstvo* *privrede* the key data items needed (max. 2h meeting)
  + Only between 20 and 30 items really fundamental 
  + Agree on fuel-energy conversion factors
  + Discuss allocation of energy/fuel items to economic sectors
    - Including the allocation to fit the scope in the Covenant of Mayors
* Establish an online sheet were items could be provided as balances are approved
  + A preliminary one already exists - not starting from zero
  + Instruct the authors of the energy balances on how to fill the table (max. 1h meeting)
* Update the current report on the basis of new data
  + Re-work trends and plots
  + Adjust text and tables
  + Send for city's approval
* Publish approved GHG monitoring report

### Compatibility with CoM

As far as possible the sector breakdown of GHG are aligned with that required by the Covenant of [Covenant of Mayors](https://eu-mayors.ec.europa.eu/en/home)(CoM). Accordingly it would be straightforward to report GHG results in the same table format making the elaboration and update of future SECAPs easier - see Table 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sector.com<-c("Municipal buildings","Public lighting","Terciary buildings","Residential buildings")
sector.com.elec<-c(45053,19089,205584,460534)
sector.com.gas<-c(10934,"NA" ,25465,102241)
  
tabb<-cbind.data.frame("Sector"=sector.com,"Electricity"=sector.com.elec,"Natural gas"=sector.com.gas)
knitr::kable(tabb, "simple",align=c("l","c","c"), caption = "Table 1 - Example of GHG reporting table for the CoM (values in tons CO2eq)")

```


### Identification of critical regions

Energy balances provide only a lump-sum of the energy needs for the canton but for the planning and implementation of policies a more granular spatial and temporal desegregation would be advantageous. For example, the emissions from liquid fuels could be made spatial for the case of transport by tapping into activity data from [comercial providors](https://www.tomtom.com/) (see Map 1) or that available in other ministries such as public transport usage, number of resisted vehicles and type, etc. This would allow to identify critical areas of intervention. For example, when it comes to road transport a disproportionately high share of traffic flows takes place in a rather restrict spatial area - see Map 1. It is therefore very likely that interventions in this region would yield very large GHG reductions in the transport sector.

![Map 1 - TomTom hit index for Sarajevo (higher index values indicate the existence of larger traffic flows)](https://ghg-sarajevo.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/tomtom22.jpg){width=700px}

### Long-term planning

Some energy usages in the canton are highly correlated with climate variability (see Figure 2). In the example provided, the highlighted dependency between gas consumption in households and temperature could be easily integrated in regional climate projection from the [IPCC](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/) in order to evaluate long-term needs for gas supply.

### From measures to GHG reductions

Finally, an adequate leveraging of the existing energy balances would allow the canton to initiate the process of investigating how infrastructure, regulatory and economic measures would translate to energy and GHG savings. For example, such could be done by looking to previous studies investigating the deployment of measures and evaluation of the subsequent impact (see Table 2). For the example provided it is reported the range of energy reductions in households brought about by the introduction of smart-meters. Applying the same measure in the canton should translate into similar energy savings, which could then be easily converted to GHG reductions.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
country<-c("UK","Italy","China","Spain","Poland")
city<-c("Exeter","Nationwide","Shangai","Bilbao","Lublin")
dimension<-c("Gas consumption","Electricity","Electricity","Heat and hot water","Heat")
red.s<-c(-22,-18,-11,-15,-20)
samples<-c("73 housholds","31 families","NA","142 dwellings","1 multi-family dwelling")

tabsm<-cbind.data.frame("Country"=country,"City"=city,"Usage"=dimension, "Reductions (%)"=red.s,
                        "Sample"=samples)
knitr::kable(tabsm, "simple",align=c("l","l","l","c","l"), caption = "Table 2 - Reduction in energy use following the introduction of smart meters (see section References for the original studies)")

```
